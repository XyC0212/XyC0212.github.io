<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I am a **Ph.D student** in the Multimodal AI Research Society (MARS) Lab, School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, advised by [Prof. Jianfei Yang](https://marsyang.site/) (Stanford World‚Äôs Top 2% Scientists). I also collaborate closely with [Prof. Chen Wang](https://sairlab.org/chenw/) and [Prof. Chaoqun Wang](https://zychaoqun.wixsite.com/chaoqun).

Prior to NTU, I obtained my MEng degree in Control Science and Engineering from **Shandong University** and received a BSc degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from the **University of Jinan**. In the past, I focused on the pratical robot applications in the field of mobile robots.

Now, I am focusing on the development of **embodied AI agents for Life Science**, combining Foundation Models and Robotic Arm in the Chem/Bio lab automation. Specifically, I hope to build a robust, safe, user-friendly embodied AI agent to help the biochemical researchers finishing some repetitive and boring work, like what copilot does for programmers and ChatGPT for writers.

During my spare time, I enjoy any sports, especially **basketball**, and playing video games, especially the Roguelike games and Pokemon. Now, I begin to explore the photography as most Ph.D students~

My research interest includes robotic navigation, motion planning, and embodied AI. I have published more than 1 papers at the top robotics journals and conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wEV8pmkAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

Feel free to send me an email at [cxy980212@gmail.com](cxy980212@gmail.com) if our interests align and I'm delighted to any collaboration and discussion oppertounities.
